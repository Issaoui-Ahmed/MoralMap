# MoralMap

This repository now uses a unified Next.js app located in `client`.

- Visit `/` for the client experience.
- Visit `/admin` for the admin dashboard (user/pass: `admin`/`admin`).

Run `npm start` inside the `client` directory to develop locally. The Next.js app exposes all API routes under `app/api`.
